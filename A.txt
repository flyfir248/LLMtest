The 2023 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2023 Cazoo World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 15 April to 1 May 2023 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the 47th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship was staged at the venue. The 15th and final ranking tournament of the 2022–23 snooker season, it was organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored for the first time by British car retailer Cazoo. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, in Europe by Eurosport, and elsewhere in the world by Matchroom Sport and other broadcasters. The total prize fund was £2,395,000, of which the winner received £500,000.

Qualifying rounds for the tournament took place from 3 to 12 April 2023 at the English Institute of Sport, featuring 128 professional and invited amateur players. The top 16 players from the snooker world rankings and another 16 players from the qualifying rounds reached the main stage of the tournament at the Crucible. Ronnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, having defeated Judd Trump 18–13 in the 2022 final. He made a record 31st Crucible appearance, surpassing the 30 appearances by Steve Davis, and made both his 200th century break at the Crucible and his 1,200th century break in professional competition during the event. O'Sullivan reached a record-extending 21st quarter-final, his 100th match at the Crucible, but lost 10–13 to Belgian player Luca Brecel.

Fan Zhengyi, Jak Jones, Pang Junxu, Si Jiahui, and Wu Yize featured at the main stage for the first time. Jones and Si both progressed to the quarter-finals, marking the first time since the 1988 event that two Crucible debutants had reached the last eight. Si, aged 20, advanced to the semi-finals, becoming the first debutant to reach the last four since Andy Hicks at the 1995 event and the youngest player to do so since O'Sullivan at the 1996 event. Brecel came from 5–14 behind to defeat Si 17–15 in the semi-finals, the first time a player had won a match at the Crucible after trailing by nine frames, and went on to defeat Mark Selby 18–15 in the final. The first player from mainland Europe to win the title, Brecel became the sport's fourth world champion in the modern era from outside the United Kingdom, after Canada's Cliff Thorburn, Ireland's Ken Doherty, and Australia's Neil Robertson.

The first-round evening sessions on 17 April were disrupted by a Just Stop Oil protest that caused one match to be postponed and the other delayed, leading to additional security measures at the venue. A total of 90 century breaks were made during the event's main stage, including two maximum breaks. Kyren Wilson made a maximum in the first round, and Selby became the first player to make a maximum in a World Championship final. Neil Robertson became the first player to make two 146 breaks in a professional match. Another 135 century breaks were made during the qualifying rounds, including a 115 break by Ng On-yee, the highest by a woman in the event's history.
